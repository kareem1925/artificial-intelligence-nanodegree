## [Sudoku-Solving AI Agent](https://github.com/mtroiani/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree/tree/master/AIND-Sudoku-master)
__Description:__ In this project, you will be writing code to implement two extensions of our sudoku solver. The first one will be to implement the technique called "naked twins". The second one will be to modify our existing code to solve a diagonal sudoku. To complete this project you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson, and build upon them.

## [Isolation Game-Playing Agent](https://github.com/mtroiani/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree/tree/master/AIND-Isolation-master)
__Description:__ Design and implement an agent to play the game of Isolation, a deterministic, two-player game in which the players alternate turns moving between cells on a regular grid till one of them has no more moves left. Use adversarial search with heuristic evaluation functions to overcome computational challenges and make your agent a smarter player.

## [Implementing a Planning Search](https://github.com/mtroiani/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree/tree/master/AIND-Planning-master)
__Description:__ Solve air cargo logistics problems by decomposing them into individual actions using a formal planning framework, identifying dependencies and effects of each action, and generating valid plans using search techniques. Experiment with various automatically generated heuristics, including planning graph heuristics, and provide an analysis of your results.

## [Build a Sign-Language Recognizer](https://github.com/mtroiani/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree/tree/master/AIND-Recognizer-master)
__Description:__ Use Hidden Markov Models to recognize gestures in American Sign Language, from individual words to complete sentences. Train it on a dataset of videos that have been pre-processed and annotated, and test on novel sequences. Improve your recognizer by finding the best English translation of each sentence.

## [Dog Breed Identifier using CNNs](https://github.com/mtroiani/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree/tree/master/AIND-Dog-Breed-master)
__Description:__ In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## [Time Series Prediction and Text Generation using RNNs](https://github.com/mtroiani/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree/tree/master/AIND-RNN-master)
__Description:__ In this project you'll build RNNs that can generate sequences based on input data - with a focus on two applications: With the first we'll use real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using an RNN model. The second one will be trained on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel Sherlock Holmes and will generate wacky sentences based on it that may - or may not - become the next great Sherlock Holmes novel!
